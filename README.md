Personal website. Ripped off a bit of webdesign from [Tommy Parnell](http://tommys.space).

Scaffolding was generated by the Yeoman webapp generator which wired up all kinds of cool stuff I don't particularly understand.

## How this works (so I can remember later).

* Make sure I have `node`/`npm` installed.
* `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
* `npm install` to get the various grunt tasks and other cool stuff.
* `bower install` to get the various front-end components - fonts, css, javascript
* `grunt serve` to host a local auto-reloading version to work on it
* `grunt build` to do all the minifying, copying, etc that the generator wired up.
    * This puts a "compiled" version of the site in `dist/`

TravisCI will do a `grunt build` and upload the resulting `dist/` folder to S3 where
it is served as a static site.
